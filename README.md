A lightweight web app that turns your **past orders** into a **taste profile** and instantly recommends restaurants that match your palate.  
Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack skills and recommender-system design.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights
- **Personalized recommendations** using a content-based filtering model (no user ratings required).  
- **Taste profile visualization** so users understand *why* each restaurant is suggested.  
- **Sub-second response time** thanks to pre-computed feature vectors and cosine-similarity lookup.  
- **Modern stack:** React(frontend), Flask REST API (backend), Scikit-learn model.  
- **Zero sensitive data:** ships with a tiny synthetic sample so anyone can run the demo locally.
